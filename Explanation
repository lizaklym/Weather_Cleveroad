When you run this task, it exits https: // localhost: 44329 / weatherforecast.
/ weatherforecast needs to be removed and then everything will work.
Unfortunately, I have some inaccuracies and flaws in my code. Since before I worked with Swagger only once.
I hope I succeeded in completing your test task as much as possible!

Yours faithfully,
Klymenko Elizaveta.
